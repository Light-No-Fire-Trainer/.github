## Light No Fire Trainer — When the World Listens Back

A continent stretches beyond the horizon. Mountains breathe cloud. Firelight trembles in the wind.
In **Light No Fire**, the world is not a backdrop — it is a living thing, vast and indifferent.

This **Light No Fire Trainer** is not here to conquer that world.
It is here to **negotiate** with it.

A precision-built PC tool that gives you adjustable control over survival systems, traversal, and experimentation — without tearing the fabric of immersion.

A trainer — external, session-based, and reversible.

Trainers are typically updated alongside major patches.
